This Python script is a simple, command-line application that functions as a basic Nutrition Guide. It is designed to provide users with general dietary and
food recommendations based on their specific age group.

FUNTIONALITY

The program defines a single function, get_nutrition_suggestion(age), which uses conditional logic (if/elif statements) to sort users into one of five categories:
Infants (0-3 years)
Children (4-12 years)
Teenagers (13-19 years)
Adults (20-60 years)
Senior Citizens (60+ years)
Based on the age entered by the user, the script returns a tailored list of suggested foods and nutritional guidelines, ranging from essential nutrients
like breast milk for infants to soft, easy-to-digest foods for seniors.

USAGE

To use this script:
Run the file from your terminal.
Enter your age when prompted.
The application will then output the relevant nutritional advice. It also includes error handling to manage cases where a user might enter text instead of a
numeric age.
